                <p>Black Creek Acres was started in Churchville, New York by Bob Maysick after retiring from Kodak in 1980. He was soon joined in this venture by his son Bill.</p>
                <P>Beginning in 1983, Black Creek Acres operated primarily as a dairy farm, selling milk through the Upstate Farms cooperative.</P>
                <p>In 2015, dairy operations ceased. Bill's son Ben, who lives in the on-sight farmhouse, currently handles much of the farm management, which now harvests and
                    sells a variety of crops, such as hay, wheat, and non-GMO soy beans and corn. </p>
                <p>In the future, they are looking to start producing maple syrup and honey as well.</p>
