    <!-- paragraphs about my hometown and college town -->
    <p>I have lived my whole life, aside from the 4 years I spent doing my
      undergradute studies in Ithaca, NY at Ithaca College, in Fairport, NY, a
      suburb about 15 minutes outside of Rochester.</P>

    <p>Perhaps the most notable thing about Fairport is the Lift Bridge crossing
      the Erie Canal (pictured above), which is unique across the world in its
      angeled design. This fact is a point of pride for many people in Fairport.
      Unfortunatly, the bridge is currently out of commmission for refurbishment,
      but luckily I haven't had to go much of anywhere recently.</P>

    <p>Like I touched on above, I went to Ithaca College for my undergradute
      studies, and studied Screenwriting, with minors in Video Game Development
      and Medieval and Renaissance History.</p>

    <p>Below is an image of part of the Ithaca College campus, with the city of
      Ithaca and Cayuga lake in the distance. Not a bad sight to see everyday.</p>

    <p><b>What I do and what I would like to do</b></p>

    <p>I work at Best Buy, specifically in the Home Theater
      department, selling TVs and audio solutions. However, I am currently
      furloughed due to COVID-19.</p>

    <P>As a result, recently I have been spending a lot of time with my
      studies, and in my free time I have been working through the mountain
      range of unread books, unplayed games, and unwatched shows and movies
      I've accumulated over the years. You can find a table of works I have
      been enjoying recently on the extras page.

    <p>I have also been trying to get back on track with some creative
      projects, since my dream ever since I discovered <i>The Lord
      of the Rings</i> in second grade has been to write a fantasy novel.</p>

    <P>Something else I enjoy, and would like to do more of someday, is travel.
      I have been to 37 US states, including Alaska, as well as Italy and the
      British Isles. My favorite place I have visited would probably by Florence,
      Italy, but that might only be because of the pear ravioli I ate there,
      which is without a doubt the most delicious thing I have ever eaten.</p>

    <p>For the future, Japan, Hong Kong, and Dubai are probably the three
      places I want to visit most.</p>
