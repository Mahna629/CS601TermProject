    <p><b>Portfolio</b></p>

    <p>Last summer I created a WordPress page to act as a portfolio for some of
      the creative projects I have worked on, including drawings, videos,
      screenplays, prose pieces, and poetry.</P>

    <a href="https://michaelj-bruno.com/">You can check it out here!</a>

    <p>Here is an example of my artwork, which is a picture of Chaya, the
      character that I play in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that has been
      going on for nearly two and half years.</p>

  <section>
    <p><b>Music</b></p>

    <p>A huge part of my life that I haven't really touched on is music,
      occasionally the playing of it, but mostly listening and appreciating.
      Music has been a huge passion of mine from a very young age, thanks to my
      dad who is also very passionate about music, and it has served as a huge
      source of inspiration for me.</p>

    <p>Some of my favorite musical artists include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Coheed and Cambria</p></li>
      <li><p>Blind Guardian</p></li>
      <li><p>Seventh Wonder</p></li>
      <li><p>Dream Theater</p></li>
      <li><p>Sabaton</p></li>
    </ul>

    <P>Here is a song that I have been listening to a lot recently, and has
      been a major source of inspiration in the last few years: Blind Guardian's
      14-minute long power metal masterpiece <i>And Then There Was Silence</i>.</p>
