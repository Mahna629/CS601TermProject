    <h2 class="acTitle">Litarature</h2>
    <section>
      <p class="acData">Almost everything I enjoy reading would fall into the broad
        category of epic fantasy. It started in childhood with The Lord of the Rings
        and grew from there into a lifelong passion. So much so that if you check
        out the pieces I've written on the <a href ="tpProjects.html">projects</a> page, they're pretty much all
        fantasy.</p>

        <p class="acData">Here are some books/series I've really enjoyed recently! (Click on them to learn more!)</P>

    <h2 class="acTitle">Music</h2>
    <section>
      <p class="acData">Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can
      remember. I've played 4 instruments throughout my life (guitar, bass, piano
      and trombone) but my true passion has always been in the listening of music.</p>

      <p class="acData">It started with my dad, also a lifelong fan of music. He
      introduced me to the classic rock bands of his childhood at a very young age,
      and that introduction would provide the foundation for my own musical
      journey that still continues to this day. My tastes have definitely skewed
      towards the heavier and more progressive ends of the spectrum since then,
      but I still find time to appreciate where it all started.</p>

     <p class="acData">Here are some of my favorite albums currently! (Click on them to learn more!)</p>

    <h2 class="acTitle">Travel</h2>
    <section>
      <p class="acData">One thing I enjoy doing is traveling, and although there
      are many places out there I would love to visit, I have been fortunate
      enough to have already visited some amazing places, even at my relativly
      young age.</p>

      <p class="acData">I have been to 37 US states, enjoyed some more than others (
      looking at you South Dakota) but my favorite travels have been to Europe.
      I minored in Medieval and Renaissance History at Ithaca College, and over
      the course of 2 trips, one to Italy in 2015, and one to the British Isles
      in 2016, I was able to visit many of the places I had learned about.</p>

      <p class="acData">Some places I would love to visit someday are: Japan, Hong
      Kong, Dubai, and the Himalayas.</p>

    <h2 class="acTitle">TV and Movies</h2>
    <section>
      <p class="acData">I've always enjoyed movies and television (I did do my
        undergrad in screenwriting after all.) The roots are the same as for my
        love of reading, The Lord of the Rings. While I never got as into the
        original novel as I would have liked, the film triology still holds a
        special place in my heart.</p>

    <h2 class="acTitle">Video Games</h2>
    <section>
      <p class="acData">I started with video games when I was quite young, less
      than 5 I believe, with sports games on PC. I think spending a lot of time
      on the computer even then started the journey that would lead me to pursuing
      software development.</p>

    <p class="acData">Over time I grew to love single player games, mainly role-playing
      games, but I still stayed mostly on PC, although I've been known to turn
      on my PS4 from time-to-time.</p>
